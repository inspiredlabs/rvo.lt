## For Lecturers

If you are looking for opportunities for students to focus on decarbonisation, we have practical domain expertise. For nearly 20 years we have developed a Sustainability Research Center, called **PeR**. We host  internships, study abroad programs and to courses to realise independent projects.

## For Students

### Now you know how to use your brain, **PeR** can teach you how to use your hands!

Students, had enough of theory? Put your studies into practice! **PeR** provides hands-on projects with sustainable methods to transfer our knowledge to your community. 

This course isn't restricted to students in one faculty. In fact, we work with architechture, design, environmental sciences, and agricultural departments all the&nbsp;time.

#### Background
In 2002 we built a zero-impact home with the aim of understanding decarbonisation. Living this way forms the basis of our Sustainability Research Center, called: **Parco dell' Energia Rinnovabile**, which is based in Umbria, Italy. 

#### Course In-Residence
Help develop **PeR**'s community-scale decarbonisation efforts. We show you how to wisely approach resource management, natural resources, materials, shelter building, transport and rethinking waste. 

#### Beyond sustainable development
As technology has become more available people are shifting their focus from sustainable development to dematerialisation. **PeR** makes the case for old and new technologies in harmony – dramatically deminishing our resource needs and improving quality of life. This combination also delivers economic benefits.

#### Research at **PeR**
Here we engage in intersectional research and aim to be the centre of revolutionising well-being. By intentionally designing an _Active&nbsp;Shelter_ we move from buildings that are something we simply maintain – to homes that serve our needs, manage resources and process waste for us.  

Our research aims to be holistic sharing how we thrive with other communities.
