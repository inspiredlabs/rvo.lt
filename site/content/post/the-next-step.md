Ten years ago, we began the sustainability research center to realise our vision. In this time, we proved our case for comfortable living standards, with a positive impact.

During the development of **PeR** we have become a source of inspiration, a place to learn, and a relaxing oasis. Our facility hosts exciting labs, an opportunity for knowledge-share and a guiding light. 

Today we take the next step. We're not proposing a paradigm shift: We are beginning a revolution. The FAIRtech Revolution â€“ it's the right thing to do.

> It is unreasonable to think comfort is not sustainable.

15 years after the initial design and a 10 year inauguration: **PeR** is evolving.  

> We are going to challenge the usual notion of progress. Our experiments and, indeed our failures have shown us we don't need to risk extinction to be happy.

## **PeR** shows us how to live well & within our means

Described as one of Italy's most virtuous, surprising structures. **PeR** shows us how to live well, yet within our means.

Through our labs, our guest researchers have realised we can go beyond zero impact. **PeR** is a reference point for fair technologies that can have a positive net impact.

> We are calling on Change Artisans to open eyes, open minds and revolt.
