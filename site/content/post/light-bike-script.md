> To Address Crisis, we have to do things differently.

Establishing shot:
BACKGROUND: LAKE DEEP IN&nbsp;NATURE

- <!--Italy--> In a world of shocks, economic stagnation and job uncertainty...
- To _Address Crisis_, we **are** doing things differently.
- By understanding the natural world, and leveraging the power of design: we're reducing waste, without&nbsp;sacrifice.

<!-- EATS MINT LEAF -->

- HUMANITY needs – low energy ways of going about daily&nbsp;life.
- But most people seen this as <!-- a challange: --> an impediment: even though the right technology already&nbsp;exists.
- _Solar panels_ aren't just for your home...
- So, we developed a simple system to recharge an unmodified street-legal <!--electric--> bike ...completely&nbsp;off&#8209;grid.
<!--- The Light Bike is a street legal device from Surron. What we have done is develop a PV array connected to a charge controller to top up the battery on the move.

MOVES TO THE SIDE EXPOSING BIKE

- And, unlike fossil fuels – this gives the&nbsp;rider, unlimited&#8209;autonomy...
- This isn't a complete contradiction, because the bike itself, weighs under&nbsp;50Kg...
- and the solar panels, collapse into the back of the&nbsp;bike.
- Making the whole system – remarkably&nbsp;portable.

PUTS SOLAR PANEL AWAY

- We call our system: **The Light Bike**.
- And, we beleive that a combination of light&nbsp;and low energy design that's naturally powered by the sun: will be the future of transport: For everyone on&nbsp;earth.
- This is just the&nbsp;begining... and is part of a larger project:
- concentrating on making _life's necessities_<!--, like transport:--> as freely available as possible.

FOCUS ON THE VIEWER

- 20 years ago, we started by building an off-grid home.
- ...this developed into a **Sustainability Research Center** called **PeR**.
- Here, we are deliberately dedicating ourselves to taking practial&nbsp;action.
- So, if you want to free life's necessities for yourself:
- Support us at **PeR**.
<!--- Join us at **PeR**. -->
