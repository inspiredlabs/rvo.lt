How You Do Anything Is How You Do Everything

Establishing shot: 
BACKGROUND: LAKE DEEP IN&nbsp;NATURE

- <!--Italy--> The world faces crop shortages, economic stagnation and job uncertainty. 
- To _Address Crisis_ we're doing things differently.
- By understanding the natural world, and leveraging the power of design: we're reducing waste, without&nbsp;sacrifice.

<!-- EATS MINT LEAF -->

- HUMANITY needs... low energy ways of going about daily&nbsp;life.
- But for most people, that's seen as an impediment.
- For example, _solar panels_ aren't just for your home.
- We have developed a simple system to recharge a street-legal <!--electric--> bike...&nbsp;OFF&#8209;GRID.
- and unlike fossil fuels: this gives the rider, unlimited&#8209;autonomy.

MOVES TO THE SIDE EXPOSING BIKE

- This isn't a complete contradiction, because the bike itself, only weighs 50Kg...
- the solar panels collapse into the back of the bike:
- making the whole vehicle remarkably portable.

PUTS SOLAR PANEL AWAY

- We call this **The Light Bike**.
- And, we beleive that the combination of staying light-weight, low energy and powered naturally by the sun:
- is the future of transport, for everyone on earth.

- ...this is part of a larger project:
- concentrating on making _life's necessities_, like transport: as freely available as possible.

FOCUS ON THE VIEWER

- 20 years ago, we started by building an off-grid home.
- ...this developed into a **Sustainability Research Center** called **PeR**.
- Here, we are deliberately dedicating ourselves to taking practial&nbsp;action.
- So, if you want to free life's necessities for yourself:
- Come and join us, visit **PeR**.
