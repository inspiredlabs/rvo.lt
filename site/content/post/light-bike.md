The Light Bike is intended for the democratic rider. If you're an eco-concious explorer, self-sufficienct survivalist or fearless&nbsp;commuter – this is for&nbsp;you!

### Power
<!-- ul class=pa0 -->
- **Street legal (L1, 50cc equivalent)**: 3KW at 28mph or&nbsp;45KmpH.
- **Off-road**: 5KW at 45mph or&nbsp;75KmpH.
- **Torque (max)**: 200N.m (Newton&nbsp;meters).
- **Weight (w. battery)**: PEV (personal electric vehicle) is&nbsp;47Kg.

### Design benefits

<!--- Overall weight footprint means that power transports the rider, rather than excess weight such as a combustion engine!-->
- No combustion engine! Overall footprint has no excess  weight, so power efficiency transports the rider&nbsp;only.
- Secure, rugged on-board recharging system.
- Reliable self contained electronics.
- Safe, typical stock roadbike.

### Unmodified street-legal frame

- The bike has an unmodified street-legal frame.
- The charge controller fits into a custom pannier rack connected to a custom collapsable&nbsp;panel.
- The charge controller is external, so the bike electronics also remain&nbsp;unmodified. 

### On-board Recharging system

- Recharge with household electricity or using our custom folding solar&nbsp;assembly.
- 70Km autonomy on a full charge.
- 0.50€ of household electricity for a full charge.
- 400W solar panels take 6h 45m for a full charge.
- Solar charge controller only weighs **300g**.

### Custom folding solar assembly 

- 4*18v, 100w monocrystaline photovoltaic panels.
- Panels are approx. the size of a sheet of A4 for mobile recharging.
- Rugged, high-efficiency, scratch resistant, flexible technology.
- On-board Recharging system (the charge controller) connects to the PEV's Panasonic Li-Ion&nbsp;cells.

### PEV Power

- Panasonic Hi-power, _18650_ lithium ion cells. 
- 60V, 32Ah rating.
- Four in-built temperature sensors and BMS (battery management&nbsp;system).

### Carrying capabilities: 100Kg (max) <!--load bearing capability-->

- 75Kg rider.
- ~15Kg personal affects.
- 8.4Kg solar panels (combined photovoltaic array: 4 * 2.1Kg).
- 3.5Kg water proof pannier and custom rack.
- Solar charge controller only weighs **300g**.

## Reduce waste to go further

We began by builing homes with the aim of self-sufficiency made possible by reducing waste. Inefficiency is everywhere, but at **PeR**, we're going further with solar to prove it's possible to do more with less.

The transport industry is wasteful. For years innovation has stagnated and that inefficiency has heavy costs. Global carbon reduction measures mean _business as&nbsp;usual_ has reached the end of the&nbsp;road. 

Previously, **PeR** has explored ecomodding as part of our personal transport experiments – but the Light Bike takes us somewhere&nbsp;new. 

This standard vehicle is lighter than the rider. Which is key, because that means you can sufficiently power the device using only the sun.

As well as the folding solar assembly you can carry camping equipment, survival gear – or just the groceries.

We aim to show people the most economical way to improve their autonomy. PEV (personal electric vehicles) are just one part of self-sufficiency. It's vitally important for people to have a sense of freedom, be able to commute and participate in the economy.

By acting clever together combining solar and mobility, we can decarbonise emmissions, improve access to services and reduce&nbsp;costs.
