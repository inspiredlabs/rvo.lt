The Light Bike is intended for the democratic rider. Irregardless of whether you are an eco-concious explorer, self-sufficienct survivalist or an fearless&nbsp;commuter!

### Overview
<!-- ul class=pa0 -->
- **Power, street legal (L1, 50cc equivalent)**: 3KW at 28mph or 45KmpH.
- **Power, off-road**: 5KW at 45mph or 75KmpH.
- **Torque (max)**: 200N.m (Newton meters).
- **Weight (w. battery)**: 47Kg.

### Design benefits

<!--- Overall weight footprint means that power transports the rider, rather than excess weight such as a combustion engine!-->
- No combustion engine! Overall footprint has no excess  weight, so power efficiency transports only the rider.
- Secure, rugged on-board recharging kit.
- Reliable self contained electronics.
- Safe like a typical roadbike.

### Street-legal and unmodified

- The bike is stock and street-legal.
- The charge controller fits into a custom pannier rack connected to a custom collapsable panel.
- The charge controller is external, so the bike electronics remain unmodified. 

### Mobile Recharging

- 70Km autonomy on a full charge.
- Recharge with mobile solar panels or household electricity.
- 0.50€ of household electricity for a full charge.
- 400W solar panels take 6h 45m for a full charge.
- Solar charge controller only weighs **300g**.

### Custom folding solar assembly 

- 4*18v, 100w monocrystaline photovoltaic panels.
- Panels are approx. the size of a sheet of A4 for mobile recharging.
- Rugged, high-efficiency, scratch resistant, flexible technology.
- Connects to Panasonic Li-Ion cells.

### Mobile Power

- Panasonic Hi-power, _18650_ lithium ion cells. 
- 60V, 32Ah rating.
- In-built quad temperature sensors and BMS (battery management system).

### Carrying capabilities: 100Kg (max) <!--load bearing capability-->

- 75Kg rider.
- ~15Kg personal affects.
- 8.4Kg solar panels (combined photovoltaic array: 4 * 2.1Kg).
- 3.5Kg water proof pannier and custom rack.
- Solar charge controller only weighs **300g**.

## Reduce waste & go further

At **PeR** we have built homes to meet carbon reduction measures – mostly by keeping waste down. We see waste everywhere and know it's possible to do more with less!

The transport industry is wasteful. To meet global carbon reduction measures, we are going lead the way by doing things better for ourselves.

This standard vehicle is lighter than the rider. This is key, because that means you can sufficiently power the device form only the sun.

As well as the person it can carry survival kit for interesting excursions – or just your groceries very economically.

We aim to show people how to improve their autonomy. Personal transport is just one aspect of self-sufficiency, but it's important because of the decarbonising effect when everybody acts clever together.
