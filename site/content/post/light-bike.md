To improve autonomy on long trips, the bike carries its own collapsible solar-array. The aim is to achieve power sufficiency, off-grid.

The bike is an unmodified, enduro SUR-RON and in the rear pannier, a self-contained photovoltaic system that is focused on efficiency. This lightweight combination means we transport everything – except battery charging worries!

This combination of a low energy vehicle and light components makes new remote destinations and longer expeditions a possibility.

This prototype stems from a larger idea challenging "sustainable development" principles. We call this the FAIRtech revolution – and look forward to telling you more!
Find us at the 2019 Maker Faire, Rome.
