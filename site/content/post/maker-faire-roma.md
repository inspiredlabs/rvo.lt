  Introducing: The Lightbike, a personal electric vehicle with combined solar charger
---

To improve autonomy on long trips, the bike has a portable solar charging system. The aim is to achieve power sufficiency, off-grid.

The bike is an unmodified enduro SUR-RON, which is very light. Stored in the rear pannier is a self-contained photovoltaic array, focused on efficiency. This lightweight combination means we transport everything – except battery charging worries!

Using portable charging components makes remote destinations a possibility for this low-powered vehicle.

This prototype stems from our ideas challenging "sustainable development" principles. We call this the FAIRTECH revolution –  dedicated to improving everybody's quality of life!
