The Light Bike is intended for the democratic rider. If you're an eco-concious explorer, self-sufficienct survivalist or fearless&nbsp;commuter – this is for&nbsp;you!


## Reduce waste to go further

### Why solar?

We began by builing homes with the aim of self-sufficiency made possible by reducing waste. Inefficiency is everywhere, but at **PeR**, we're going further with solar to prove it's possible to do more with less.

The transport industry is wasteful. For years innovation has stagnated and that inefficiency has heavy costs. Global carbon reduction measures mean _business as&nbsp;usual_ has reached the end of the&nbsp;road.

### Ecomodding

Previously, **PeR** has explored ecomodding as part of our personal transport experiments – but the Light Bike takes us somewhere&nbsp;new.

This standard vehicle is lighter than the rider. Which is rare, because that means you can sufficiently power the device using only the sun.

As well as the folding solar assembly you can carry camping equipment, survival gear – or just the groceries.

### **PeR**, leading the way in sun-sufficiency!

We aim to show people the most economical way to improve their autonomy. PEV (personal electric vehicles) are just one part of self-sufficiency. It's vitally important for people to have a sense of freedom, be able to commute and participate in the economy. **PeR** is teaching people how to combine solar and mobility for themselves.


### Positive benefits to society

Acting clever together we can improve access to services, decarbonise emmissions and diminish running&nbsp;costs<!-- to virtually&nbsp;zero-->.
