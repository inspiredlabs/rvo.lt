Ten years ago, we began the sustainability research center to realise our vision. In this time, we proved our case for comfortable living standards, with a positive impact.

During PeR's development we have become a source of inspiration, a place to learn, and a relaxing oasis. Our facility hosts exciting labs, an opportunity for knowledge-share and a guiding light. 

Today we take the next step. We're not proposing a paradigm shift: We're going to start a revolution. The Fair Tech Revolution – rvo.lt

> It's the right thing to do, for people and planet.

Alessandro Ronca, co-founder of PeR, Umbria has experience, vision and a team for change.

> 15 years after the initial design and a 10 year inauguration: PeR is evolving. We are going to challenge the usual notion of progress.  It is unreasonable to think comfort is not sustainable. Our experiments and failures have shown us we don't need to risk extinction to be happy. 

## PeR shows us how to live well, yet within our means

Described as one of Italy's most virtuous, surprising structures. PeR shows us how to live well, yet within our means.

> Through our labs, our guest researchers have realised we can go beyond zero impact. We are a reference point for fair technologies that have a positive impact. We are calling on Artisans for Change to open eyes, and open minds.
