# The world is better than ever

## Due to technological progress we're managing energy and resources better than ever. This is improving everyone's well-being without unwanted side-effects.

Today, Nations, Governments and Corporations are asking, how do we approach decarbonisation? 

At **PeR** we have made decarbonisation a reality for our community for over 10 years. During, we have become conscious of loose measures to help us track our progress.

### What is FAIRtech?

#### FAIRtech is a fast way to asses projects. 

Use these loose measures to track your own capacity to:

* reduce what is scarce, preserve what is important and maintain constraints. Investments in time and attention, are: **Finite**.
* connect, teach and share responsibility. Network effects result in powerful waves. How can you: **Amplify**?
* what are your priorities? Aim to improve your core idea. Make things as simple as possible, but not simpler. Make it: **Irreducible**.
* Can you gain from disorder? Test and iterate using feedback loops. Prove your project is: **Reliable**.
