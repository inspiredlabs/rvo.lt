# More from Less {#more-from-less}

## Listen

[Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/ideacast/2019/09/dematerialization-and-what-it-means-for-the-economy-and-climate-change.html) book promotion.

## Background reading

Original inspiration for the book: [**The Return of Nature**, How Technology Liberates the Environment](https://thebreakthrough.org/journal/issue-5/the-return-of-nature), by Jesse H. Ausubel.

> We’ve already seen some plateaus – Andrew McAfee

## Book contents

- Described as the great decoupling: humanity no longer needs to extract excessive natural resources, nor expend as much energy. Essentially because CAD/CAM = **Dematerialisation**.
- This process in motion across all geographies. It is described as: _slim, swap, optimise & evaporate_.
- This process is called Dematerialisation because we no longer need as much physical materials to live on a day-to-day basis. This is described as _"Peak stuff"_, meaning, we are consuming less... but increasing our economy, regardless.
- This is an important part of the modern global economy because it improves access, whilst lowering the amount of material energy required to deliver on its promise(s).
- Understand that _"combinatorial innovation"_ is always speeding up (~exponent), because as new building blocks are added they always improve the general efficacy of existing means and ways.
- importance of advocating: constraining capitalism appropriately... Especially from p386: _Interventions: How to be good_.

> Decarbonisation isn't happening quickly enough – Andrew McAfee

- Teach what you know: it has powerful implications, strengthens usable ideas and improves: _Human Capital_.
- Help the poor upgrade (this acts as an on-ramp to other capitalist developments).
- The following can't be underestimated:
	- Energy efficiency and clean sources of energy.
	- Precision agriculture.
	- Electric transport.
- Advocating "The four horsemen of the optimist":
	- prosperity makers:
		- intense competition & contested markets.
		- tech progress.
	- win hearts & minds (listening is profitable):
		- responsive government (Regulation, decrease emissions & pollution: tax corporate-scale offenders & bolster social democratic policy).
		- public awareness (correct info & effective activism).
