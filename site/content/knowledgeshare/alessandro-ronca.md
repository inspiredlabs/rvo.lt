Alessandro Ronca is a sustainability artisan and polymath.

Attracted to many different things, his Mum would say _too many_ – although always supportive during each and every&nbsp;chapter!

After years working in Africa, Central America and around the Indian Ocean in Construction Management, Alessandro became an accomplished Diving&nbsp;Instructor.

After dealing with difficult environmental situations, he choose to a new direction: to design and develop **PeR**: a sustainability research center based around energy&nbsp;techologies.

During the management of **PeR**, it became apparent <!--to Alessandro -->that technology over-promises and under&nbsp;delivers. Progress has been intensive, but humanity's footprint sinks under its own _weight_.

Technology is of true value to Humanity when in absolute&nbsp;balance. It's this principle that directs the "Fairtech Revolution": a combination of technology in harmony with the planet and a human component, tapping into our inner&#8209;power.


<!--Alessandro Ronca a co-founder and the President of **PeR**, a _Sustainability Research Center_ in Italy. After years developing Africa and other states with difficult environmental situations, he has dedicated himself to new energetic techologies. By establishing **Parco dell' Energia Rinnovabile**, his goal has been to pursue and spread a sustainable, self-sufficient life-style.-->
