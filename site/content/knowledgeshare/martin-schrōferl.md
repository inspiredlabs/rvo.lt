# Generalist &amp; Trike&nbsp;Designer

Martin Schrōferl is a German Programmer, design engineer and recumbant trike maker&hellip; amongst other things, he even stitched the&nbsp;panieers!

## No ordinary trike

Martin developed an advanced carbon fibre recumbant. This [design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDXVPzfeKU0) is truly compelling, not least because he and his wife rode them all the way from Germany to&nbsp;Italy.

<!--# Democratic Design

At **PeR**, we believe in the power of design.

## Power assist

Martin Schrōferl's recumbant uses a [cheap RC motor](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=powerful%2Btorque%2BRC%2Bmotor&_sacat=0&rt=nc&_udlo=39&_udhi=99) to augment pedal-power which is both powerful and efficient. The result is a democratic, cost-effictive Personal&nbsp;EV.

## Off-grid lifestyle

He is the only person in Germany to have developed his own completely off-grid&nbsp;house.
