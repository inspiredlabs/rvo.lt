## Generalist

Martin Schrōferl is a German Programmer, design engineer and recumbant builder, amongst other things – he even stitched the panieers!

## Unique

He is the only person in Germany to have built his own totally off-grid&nbsp;house.

## No ordinary trike

Martin developed an advanced carbon fibre recumbant. This [design](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5C4TJ2zpJRwl9McnaSZrEg) is truly compelling, not least because he and his wife rode them all the way from Germany to&nbsp;Italy.

# Democratic Design

At **PeR**, we believe in the power of design. 

## Power assist

Martin Schrōferl's recumbant uses a [cheap RC motor](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=powerful%2Btorque%2BRC%2Bmotor&_sacat=0&rt=nc&_udlo=39&_udhi=99) to augment pedal-power which is both powerful and efficient. The result is a democratic, cost-effictive Personal&nbsp;EV.
