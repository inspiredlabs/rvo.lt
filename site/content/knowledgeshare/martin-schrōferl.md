Martin Schrōferl developed an advanced carbon fibre recumbant. This [design](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5C4TJ2zpJRwl9McnaSZrEg) is compelling for many reasons, not least he and his wife used them to ride all the way from Germany to Italy.

# Democratic Design

At **PeR**, we believe in the power of design. 

Martin's recumbant uses an RC motor to augment pedal-power which is both powerful and efficient. These are highly cost-effictive, providing the most democratic form of personal transport.
