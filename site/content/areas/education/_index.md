There is an urgent need to understand the physical&nbsp;world. 

Our ancestors learned everything hands-on, in&nbsp;nature. 

Energetic tutelage, play and trial-and-error help inform mastery, improve coordination and develop focus. These are vital for discipline, applying abstract&nbsp;ideas and growth.

- Our work at **PeR** concerning the 5 key areas: "HEFTS".
- Expert templates: low impediment, low energy solutions to life's necessities through our crowdsource initative.
