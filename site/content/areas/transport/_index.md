# Rational&nbsp;transport

## Key levels of the network

A modern transport network will work across distributed key&nbsp;levels: _Community Scale_ is our present&nbsp;focus.

<!-- The key levels.-->
<!--
A modern transport network will have the following characteristics:
- x
- y
- z-->

## Electrify

The name that springs to mind when we think about modern transport is _Elon&nbsp;Musk_ <!-- You might have heard of him-->. Electric cars are not a futuristic idea. They have a rich, long history&hellip; although they are only part of the&nbsp;answer. 

### History <!--Electric Wonderland-->

There is often a trade-off between low energy and long&nbsp;distance.<!-- personal&nbsp;vehicles. -->

Patents relating to electric cars go back to around 1884. A relatively sophisticated alkaline battery debut in&nbsp;1913, by&nbsp;[Thomas&nbsp;Edison](https://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/10/18/in-1912-henry-ford-edison-came-together-to-conceive-a-low-priced-electric-car/).

### Rethinking electric vehicles

<!--### Community scale&nbsp;transport-->

Our answer to liberating the transport system begins with **The&nbsp;Light&nbsp;Bike**. A person weighs about 80Kg, and the vehicle weighs about half of&nbsp;that. With a distance-to-weight ratio that seems as if it's a _complete&nbsp;contradiction_, we improve on autonomy – yet reduce&nbsp;energy!
