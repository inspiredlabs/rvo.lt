# Technical Block

## Overview

Equipped with a self-contained bathroom, kitchen and&nbsp;utility.

Initially mobile, the **Technical Block** can be deployed in emergency, onto under-used urban space or <!--temporarily,--> anywhere&nbsp;permissable!

Discrete from a greenhouse, living quarters and storage the **Technical Block** is easy to move.

## Discrete, iterative design

The goal is to make the complex, simply&nbsp;livable.

With all the components in one place, this reduces cost and delivery considerations. The living space can then be tailored to the environment and in harmony with locally sourced means and&nbsp;materials.

## Delivery

We plan to deliver broadly applicable guidelines for  design, orientation and thermo-efficiency to suit people's needs. Although, efficacy will largely depend on&nbsp;implementation.

> We set out to design and deploy a scalable&nbsp;homestead

## Internally Equipped
- Integrated&nbsp;power:
	- sheild summer sun with solar panels
	- batteries stored away from heat and water
	- operational energy ~4+ people
	- low maintainence
- Bathroom:
	- Heated radiator
	- Natural light and ventilation
	- Swing-door plumbing access
	- Sink and shower:
		- hot and cold running water
		- process/filter/reuse gray water
	- <!-- DUAL (decarbonisation/dematerialisation universal automated luxury) mist shower: https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2019/10/mist-showers-sustainable-decadence.html#more -->
	- Toilet:
		- secure sanitation
		- reduces smells
		- process waste
- Kitchen:
	- Natural light and ventilation
	- Pantry (passive refrigeration):
		- small breathable, dry pantry to chill domestic supplies ~10°C - 15°C
		- optimally positioned
		- zero running cost <!--based on: Zeer Pots, from: http://www.provident-living-today.com/Alternative-Refrigeration.html-->
<!--		- integrated inside external water collector-->
	- Sink<!-- and dishwasher-->:
		- hot and cold running water
		- process/filter/reuse gray water
	- Cook:
		- insulated hob
		- J-Rocket stove
		- slow cooker and solar reflector
		- safe and organised utensil storage
	- Compost food:
		- automatically from the preparation area
- Vehicle storage:
	- secure a small vehicle, such as **The Light Bike** <!--[The Light Bike](https://rvo.lt/light-bike)-->
	- recharge a light electric vehicle _(power req.)_ with the integrated&nbsp;power
- External water collector (2 main vessels):
	- ceramic gravity filter<!--http://www.provident-living-today.com/Gravity-Water-Filter.html-->
	- cold water tank <!--with integrated pantry to reduce ambient air temparature ~10°C - 15°C (aerated with sand to prevent condensation)-->
	- hot water tank to store solar heated water <!--from glass tubes-->


## Configure the&nbsp;space

Rooms should be tailored to the&nbsp;environment.

- A greenhouse:
	- improve autonomy and food security
	- grow food and practice qualitative agriculture
	- automatically process food
	- adobe for heat storage
	- sheild summer sun with solar panels <!-- live like a caveman in jeans: https://youtu.be/P3-IjnIX_DM?t=525 -->
- Living room, dining and study&nbsp;areas:
	- natural light and ventilation
	- simple, passive heating
	- insulated with adobe
- Bedrooms
	- orientated for healthy sleep
	- facing the sunset
	- cosy

## Externally Equipped

- Extra integrated&nbsp;power:
	- Mixed solar panels harness efficiencies:
		- Monocrystalline (warm weather panels, efficiency @15-20%): even, uniform high-purity&nbsp;silicon)
		- Polycrystalline (simple and cost less, efficiency @13-16%, 25-year&nbsp;lifetime)
		- Thin-Film Solar Panels (cloudy weather panels, large array required, flexible and cheap, efficiency 9%, short lifetime&nbsp;warranty)
- A myriad of other options for a scalable&nbsp;homestead.

### What is refrigeration?

- Refrigeration slows down the growth of bacteria and molds

### Why refridgerate?

- x

### burlap evaporation cooler (not refridgerated):

- grapes
- cherries
- potatoes (around 15°C): starch-sugar conversion (which give off moisture)

- from: http://www.provident-living-today.com/Alternative-Refrigeration.html

### What not to refridgerate?

- tomatoes: contain a self-destroying aromatic compound
- pears: catalysts help ripen, like ethylene (from bananas)
- onions: rot around moisture (don't store with potatoes)


architecture

Active technologies, choosing to rethinking the foundations. Flexible, remote and movable, democratic, self-sufficient, help to grow your food (pink light in the work-shop).

Active Shelter characteristics

- A shelter that gives more than the energy that went into creating it.
- this is different from a Smart House (called: Domotics, Adj.). <!--Smart House: wooden house at the back bricks at the front?-->
- waste: managed by an active digester (a septic tank is passive, and needs a lot of mass). Waterloop System - ASA Boot Electro.
	- compost toilet (primer: https://www.pickatoilet.com/best-composting-toilet-reviews/).
	- amonia + biochar activation from your pee!
	- graywater is connected to the degreaser, removing fat (fiberous material, hair etc). Like in the zero energy house.
- organics are used in the plastic centre, and the outside is eaten by worms.
	- like hydroponics. Tilapia fertilise food. https://duckduckgo.com/?q=goldfish+that+ferilise+the+indor+hydroponics&t=osx&iax=images&ia=images
