<!--• Was also suggesting to place a side of the PeR ruins in the “The Next step” section, the PeR refurbished to give immediatly the idea of the huge job done in PeR
• somewhere insert a link to PeR english site to connect better the two entities. She was also suggesting to insert the logo of fair tech on the section of “ Fair tech revolution”
• saing that this are the basic pillar that need to be overhaul, we and logical improvement of efficiencies, with a reduction but with no incovenience.Otherwise we mention this area on the Univesity section without explaination of why we are concentrated on this 5 areas, do you not agree? When you’ll be able to make this little adjustment, if is possible, I can send you the translation of the site in italian and if possible copypaste in a Italian version, with a classic button on the english site. Even if the site will remain opening in English.-->
# <!--**PeR**: a-->A relaxing&nbsp;oasis

## Realising our&nbsp;vision

<!--Under development since&nbsp;2000--> The idea behind  **PeR** was to have a positive&nbsp;impact creating comfortable living standards, in a sustainable&nbsp;way.

During our development, we have proven comfort doesn't require&nbsp;sacrifice – and there is a need for&nbsp;inspiration.

# <!--**PeR**: a-->A guiding light

By building a _sustainability research&nbsp;center_ we have inspired thousands of [visitors](https://www.facebook.com/PeRIlParcodellaEnergiaRinnovabile/) to take steps toward&nbsp;self-sufficiency.

Our facility hosts exciting labs, an opportunity for knowledge-share and a practical platform to build new&nbsp;ideas<!-- , unrestrained by&nbsp;dogma-->.

And it's here that we came up with the concept of making Fairtech:
- low cost. democratically available to all
- low impediment,
- low maintainence, 
- low energy
- high impact
- for high demand markets, such as the emerging Global South.

## The future is already&nbsp;here



**PeR** is already starting from a structure that has complete water self-sufficiency thanks to rainwater recovery, which uses passive heating and cooling systems, which relies on spaces suitable for research and design in the field of renewable energy and sustainable systems, which sees laboratories equipped to build prototypes and which has rooms and facilities suitable for hosting individuals and groups





Fairtech comes from our approach to design and implementation at **PeR**. By creating community resilience for ourselves, we are in sharing knowledge to encourage collaboration – to make **HEFTS** free!

<!--## Reimagine: Purpose-->
<!-- beat future&nbsp;challenges. -->
<!--Fairtech is a community resilience platform developed by [PeR](https://inspiredlabs.co.uk/per.umbria.it/en/) to share knowledge of self-sufficiency, encourage collaboration and beat future&nbsp;challenges.-->
<!--During PeR's development we have become a source of inspiration, a place to learn, and a relaxing oasis. Our facility hosts exciting labs, an opportunity for knowledge-share and a guiding light.-->




Today we take the next step. We're not proposing a paradigm shift: We are beginning a revolution. The FAIRtech Revolution – it's the right thing to do.

> It is unreasonable to think comfort is not sustainable.

15 years after the initial design and a 10 year inauguration: **PeR** is evolving.  

> We are going to challenge the usual notion of progress. Our experiments and, indeed our failures have shown us we don't need to risk extinction to be happy.

## **PeR** shows us how to live well & within our means

Described as one of Italy's most virtuous, surprising structures. **PeR** shows us how to live well, yet within our means.

Through our labs, our guest researchers have realised we can go beyond zero impact. **PeR** is a reference point for fair technologies that can have a positive net impact.
