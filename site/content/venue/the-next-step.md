Fairtech comes from a general approach to design and implementation at [PeR](https://inspiredlabs.co.uk/per.umbria.it/en/). By creating community resilience for ourselves, we are in sharing knowledge to encourage collaboration – to make **HEFTS** free!

<!--Fairtech is a community resilience platform developed by [PeR](https://inspiredlabs.co.uk/per.umbria.it/en/) to share knowledge of self-sufficiency, encourage collaboration and beat future&nbsp;challenges.-->
<!--During PeR's development we have become a source of inspiration, a place to learn, and a relaxing oasis. Our facility hosts exciting labs, an opportunity for knowledge-share and a guiding light.-->

Ten years ago, we began the sustainability research center to realise our vision. In this time, we proved our case for comfortable living standards, with a positive impact.

During the development of **PeR** we have become a source of inspiration, a place to learn, and a relaxing oasis. Our facility hosts exciting labs, an opportunity for knowledge-share and a guiding light. 

Today we take the next step. We're not proposing a paradigm shift: We are beginning a revolution. The FAIRtech Revolution – it's the right thing to do.

> It is unreasonable to think comfort is not sustainable.

15 years after the initial design and a 10 year inauguration: **PeR** is evolving.  

> We are going to challenge the usual notion of progress. Our experiments and, indeed our failures have shown us we don't need to risk extinction to be happy.

## **PeR** shows us how to live well & within our means

Described as one of Italy's most virtuous, surprising structures. **PeR** shows us how to live well, yet within our means.

Through our labs, our guest researchers have realised we can go beyond zero impact. **PeR** is a reference point for fair technologies that can have a positive net impact.
