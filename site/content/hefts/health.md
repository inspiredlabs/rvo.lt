# The first rule of&nbsp;health

## Don't get sick

As welfare diminishes, governments around the world are shifting responsibility back onto people to look after themselves. This is a big change in Post-War health care. 

We beleive strongly that health care should be free – but until we mandate improvements to health outcomes, the onus is on&nbsp;us.

# PeR's holistic approach

## The human component

**PeR** is a reference point for fair technologies – these include a _human&nbsp;component_. By understanding our connection with nature, we can better live&nbsp;fully. 

## Ancient ways

We help people seize control of their health by instructing how we connect with nature. Ancient ways are, not only harmless – but supported by medical&nbsp;science.

## A simple diet

We provide exceptionally simple dietary advice. **PeR** grows and prepares homegrown food. Other dishes are supported by local suppliers. Decent ingredients, combined with tried and tested recipies make for healthy colourful plates. Changing your life never tasted so&nbsp;good.

## Fasting

Modern science explains how restraining what we eat is both natural and optimal for the&nbsp;body.

Caloric restriction can benefit everyone. **PeR** can assist you on your journey to understanding the&nbsp;body.

## Healing

Our experience of natural healing has informed us how to respond to the body.

This may encourage gentle routine change for those who are ready to commit to their own&nbsp;healing.
