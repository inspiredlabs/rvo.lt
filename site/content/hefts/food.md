# Permaculture

**PeR** practices growing food simply. We use permaculture methods which are free, healthy and require a little&nbsp;effort.

# Agronomy

Agronomy is the scientific study of soil. It's important to note that it borrows some ancient techniques from the **Aggrarian-age** in combination with the modern scientific&nbsp;method.

# Agrarian knowledge

Soil knowledge became vital to growing food for larger and larger groups of&nbps;people. This includes methods such as crop-rotation and irrigation.

# Ancient ways

The ancient diet consisted of raw and fermented food that contained good bacteria.

# Fermented food

Fermented foods are technically called **Probiotics**.

Eat naturally fermented food, because your gut flora needs extra good bacteria.

<!--
- drinks such as kombucha or coconut kefir are easy to find.
- Probiotic – or fermented – food contain large amounts of nutrients and phytochemicals.
	- CHEAP & EASY: Literally get a jar, add water, salt, veggies, seal – put in a cupboard for 3-10 days. Boom: fermented probiotics.
		- Chicory root, artichoke, dandelion greens, asparagus are all good. -->
