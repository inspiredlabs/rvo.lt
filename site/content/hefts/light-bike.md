The Light Bike is intended for the democratic rider. If you're an eco-concious explorer, self-sufficienct survivalist or fearless&nbsp;commuter – this is for&nbsp;you!

### Power
<!-- ul class=pa0 -->
- **Street legal (L1, 50cc equivalent)**: 3KW at 28mph or&nbsp;45KmpH.
- **Off-road**: 5KW at 45mph or&nbsp;75KmpH.
- **Torque (max)**: 200N.m (Newton&nbsp;meters).
- **Weight (w. battery)**: PEV (personal electric vehicle) is&nbsp;47Kg.

### Design benefits

<!--- Overall weight footprint means that power transports the rider, rather than excess weight such as a combustion engine!-->
- No combustion engine! Overall footprint has no excess  weight, so power efficiency transports the rider&nbsp;only.
- Secure, rugged on-board recharging system.
- Reliable self contained electronics.
- Safe stock roadbike.

### Unmodified street-legal frame

- The bike has an unmodified street-legal frame.
- The charge controller fits into a custom pannier rack connected to a custom collapsable&nbsp;panel.
- The charge controller is external, so the bike electronics also remain&nbsp;unmodified.

### On-board Recharging system

- Recharge with household electricity or using our custom folding solar&nbsp;assembly.
- 70Km autonomy on a full charge.
- 0.50€ of household electricity for a full charge.
- 400W solar panels take 6h 45m for a full charge.
- Solar charge controller only weighs **300g**.

### Custom folding solar assembly

- 4*18v, 100w monocrystaline photovoltaic panels.
- Panels are approx. the size of a sheet of A4 for mobile recharging.
- Rugged, high-efficiency, scratch resistant, flexible technology.
- On-board Recharging system (the charge controller) connects to the PEV's Panasonic Li-Ion&nbsp;cells.

### PEV Battery

- Panasonic Hi-power, _18650_ lithium ion cells.
- 60V, 32Ah rating.
- Four in-built temperature sensors and BMS (battery management&nbsp;system).

### Carrying capabilities: 100Kg (max) <!--load bearing capability-->

- 75Kg rider.
- ~15Kg personal affects.
- 8.4Kg solar panels (combined photovoltaic array: 4 * 2.1Kg).
- 3.5Kg water proof pannier and custom rack.
- Solar charge controller only weighs **300g**.
