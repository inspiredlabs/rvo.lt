## The Present&nbsp;Consensus

Progress it seems, is short of a consensus on exactly what we should&nbsp;eat. Sam&nbsp;Harris, talking with Dr. Nina&nbsp;Shapiro, summed&#8209;up this humiliation&nbsp;perfectly&hellip;

> One&nbsp;of the greatest embarrassments to modern science <!--that there's any diversity of opinion at all about what human beings should eat, so as to be healthy.How--> is that we don't have a rock-solid consensus of a healthy&nbsp;diet  <!--[in this day in age]--> – [Sam Harris (skip: 55:35)](https://samharris.org/podcasts/129-insiders-view-medicine/) 

## Why does what we eat&nbsp;mystify?

There is no _one_ perfect answer to diet for every single&nbsp;person. <!--on this entire&nbsp;planet. That's impossible.-->

That's becasue over hundreds of thousands of years of human evolution, we have flourished to require _very little food_ on a day-to-day basis. Yet when we do eat – our&nbsp;gut is organised to extract as much nutrients from that&nbsp;source.

Knowing this, we can simplify healthy&nbsp;eating.<!-- without&nbsp;sacrifice.-->

# The Rainbow&nbsp;Diet

## Fresh, &amp; Nutrient-Dense

Fresh&nbsp;foods are most nutrient-dense and grow in&nbsp;nature. <!-- with all the colours of the&nbsp;rainbow. Choosing vegatables high in vitamins and minerals is important.-->

Eating all the colours of the&nbsp;rainbow, is a great starting&nbsp;point. Any diet should hydrate, be high in nutrients and low in processed&nbsp;foods – which come in man-made packaging, making them easy to&nbsp;spot! 

## Eat in harmony

Locally sourced, seasonally available food is also&nbsp;optimal.


<!--

# Locally sourced

Ideally, food should be locally sourced.

### High in Nutrients
Eat nutrients: proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, minerals, and water.

eat real food. Food is anything that comes naturally from the earth. It is not altered, modified, or processed.
