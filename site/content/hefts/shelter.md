### A Proof-of-concept 

Our South-facing passively conditioned house is the center of our tours around **PeR**. 

#### **PeR** combines the following technologies 

- Rain water collection and reuse
	- A network of pipes and filters helps us reuse grey water for flushing toilets. We keep rain water for showering and use in the sink.
- Solar heating
	- We store around 4,000 litres of natural heat which circulates inter­seasonally.
- Biomass heating
	- We recycle waste into useful, economical pellets.
- Natural cooling ventilation
	- Underground pipes help keep the air in the building fresh
	- Modified appliances attain near-optimum efficiency
	- Our washing machines use pre-heated water. Far more economical than standard dish and clothes appliances.


- Solar efficiency
	- Our low impact house uses a glass enclosure and simple piping to heat the building.
	- We have modern greenhouses that combine technologies to retain heat and improve growing.
- Lighting efficiency
	- Tubes and mirrors redirect light into the building.
	- All our lights work through our integrated solar system.
- Energy generation
	- We have wind generators and solar panels.
	- Different battery types for redundancy.
- Photovoltaic systems
	- Thin-film solar panels (still works during cloudy weather).
	- Monocrystalline solar panels (works optimally in bright sunshine).
- Irrigation pumps.
- Electric Fences (keep out the wild without harm).
