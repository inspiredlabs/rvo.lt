<!--# Policy, Practice &amp; Purpose-->

<!--# Reimagine:&nbsp;Purpose-->

<!--# Practical safety&nbsp;net-->

## For&nbsp;everybody

We realised these five categories are special. They are **Transcalar**: meaning, they scale in all directions. They are just as important for communities, nomadic people, and developed civilisations – all over the&nbsp;globe!

**Non-rivalry** suggests there can be a way to benefit without competition. For example improving your own health doesn't reduce someone else’s&nbsp;well-being. 

<!-- Can we start to reinforce people's well-being in a free low-energy way? -->

## Practical safety net

Talk to people about **"HEFTS"** and you realise how transcalar this idea is. Individuals, professionals, business leaders, politicians and global policy makers all have a role to play in making communities resilient. 

Together we can overcome challenges. Becoming more resilient requires a co-ordinated movement large enough to affect change – and **PeR** encourages engineers to stretch the practicality of making "HEFTS" free.

## Crowdsource

At **PeR** we are exploring these ideas at community&nbsp;level. But, a willing network is required to share transcalar, non-rivalous answers. <!-- People make the difference – _how can you take this idea&nbsp;further?_ -->

Are you an engineer that wants to share your expertise freely and improve&nbsp;lives?

Those able to share their time, can advocate by emailing their profile&nbsp;page.

<!--## Who should join?-->

## Who&nbsp;are we looking&nbsp;for?

### Generalists

We are looking for Makers, Designers and Engineers. We want to focus on <!--low impact, low maintainence,--> low&nbsp;impediment solutions to make "HEFTS" as democratically available as&nbsp;possible.



## Adapt, Upgrade &amp;&nbsp;Share

By optimsing away red-tape our designs should be Open-Source and shared freely. 

Adaptations for local materials and methods will serve as a feedback loop to reduce the pitfalls of&nbsp;experimentation. 

**Localised&nbsp;participation** means that after designs have been tested, they can be adapted for use&nbsp;elsewhere. 

<!--Together we can overcome challenges. -->

<!--
## Global fix

Making adaptive designs will be unlike the original due to local resources and tools. But design implementation that anticipate adaptation means we can act before crisis hits.-->

<!--## Make it&nbsp;work-->

## High&nbsp;Impact

### <!--Low&nbsp;maintainence. -->Low&nbsp;impediment. Low&nbsp;energy.

Together we can overcome challenges. Becoming more resilient requires a co-ordinated movement large enough to affect change – and **PeR** encourages collaboration non-rival answers to&nbsp;problems.

## For&nbsp;critics

Your input may improve our&nbsp;reach and&nbsp;reliability. 

We aim to provide an engineering solution where there might be future _market&nbsp;failure_. Doing so, we're unearthing benefits such as upskilling and cost&nbsp;savings! 

> It's just shoddy Socialism&nbsp;–&nbsp;Amirite?!

Any attempt to guide people away from capital investment, reasonable labour value or democratic convention is simply&nbsp;naïve.

Our system is to encourge sharing proven low/no-tech design, uncommon wisdom and executing projects using modern&nbsp;principles.

### Motivation

The market is seeking win-win crisis&nbsp;mitigation. Although, we expect dematerialisation to be correlated with purpose before&nbsp;profit.

<!--Why not prepare to avoid unecessary discomfort?-->

<!--
## For&nbsp;entreprenures

Any _actual_ innovation should be assessed if a patent is worth the investment. Considering what we've learned from entreprenureship in SZ, in practice defending ideas can be costly and their value is easier to realise as bargaining chips during funding&nbsp;rounds – or as the final word in an exit&nbsp;strategy.

<!-- emergancy preparedness -->

## For&nbsp;Economists

Applied like this **Transcalar** means leveraging zero-marginal cost applied _acceptably_ to life's necessities<!-- (as early as possible)-->. 

By acceptably, we mean:

- The total life-cycle cost analysis must be attainable and pragmatic when considering&nbsp;externalities.
- Investments in waste reducution, processing and engergetic defficiencies should be not be cost-prohibitive.
- Frame "HEFTS", as _utilitarian_ <!--_just and equitable manner_--> (prior to any&nbsp;mandate).

The five categories: "HEFTS", require extra intervention to normalise a reduction in energy, materials and tools to achive security before a&nbsp;crisis.

<!--## For&nbsp;Degrowthers-->

At grass-roots level, people may adopt this as an _alternative lifestyle_. Conciencous people involved in the **Degrowth Movement** will appreciate our approach to&nbsp;resources. 

Although we can learn a lot from Earthships, Degrowthers and FOSS – the adaptive capacity of capitalism is not to be&nbsp;underestimated. <!--Hopefully it will enhance the market for everyone's&nbsp;betterment.-->

<!-- # Purpose -->

## For Change Artisans

<!-- ## Make&nbsp;the future&nbsp;free -->

Deflecting a Climate Crisis, Economic Stagnation and Job Uncertainty is an opportunity. By investing in life's&nbsp;necessities we might just make&nbsp;the future_&nbsp;free_.

<!--
Practical&nbsp;action by Change&nbsp;Artisans everywhere to defend life's&nbsp;necessities.

## How did Fairtech begin?

### Resilience is transcalar

We realised these five categories are special. They are **Transcalar**: meaning, they scale in all directions. And, are just as important for communities, nomadic people, and developed civilisations – all over the&nbsp;globe!

**Transcalar** suggests there is always the potential to benefit from improvments. For example: improving your health is non-rivalrous – it won't change someone else’s&nbsp;well-being.

If you talk to people about **"HEFTS"**, you'll realise how **transcalar** this idea is because individuals, professionals, business leaders, politicians and global policy makers all have a role to play in making communities resilient that can overcome any challenge!
