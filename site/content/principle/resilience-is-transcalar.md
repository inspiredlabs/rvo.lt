# For&nbsp;everybody

We realised these five categories are special. They are **Transcalar**: meaning, they scale in all directions. And, are just as important for communities, nomadic people, and developed civilisations – all over the&nbsp;globe!

**Transcalar** suggests there is always the potential to benefit from improvements, and improving your health is non-rivalrous – it won't change someone else’s&nbsp;well-being.

## Policy and practice

Talk to people about **"HEFTS"** and you realise how **transcalar** this idea is. Individuals, professionals, business leaders, politicians and global policy makers all have a role to play in making communities resilient.

Together we can overcome challenges such as The Climate Crisis or economic uncertainty by encouraging collaboration to become more resilient to&nbsp;shocks

## How did Fairtech begin?

### Resilience is transcalar

We realised these five categories are special. They are **Transcalar**: meaning, they scale in all directions. And, are just as important for communities, nomadic people, and developed civilisations – all over the&nbsp;globe!

**Transcalar** suggests there is always the potential to benefit from improvments. For example: improving your health is non-rivalrous – it won't change someone else’s&nbsp;well-being.

If you talk to people about **"HEFTS"**, you'll realise how **transcalar** this idea is because individuals, professionals, business leaders, politicians and global policy makers all have a role to play in making communities resilient that can overcome any challenge!
