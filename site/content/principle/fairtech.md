# Developed by **PeR**

**PeR** is pronounced in Italian as [Il Parco dell' Energia Rinnovabile](https://per.umbria.it), meaning "renewable energy park": [Learn more &#x279D;](https://inspiredlabs.co.uk/per.umbria.it/en/).

**PeR** is the largest and most comprehensive sustainability research centre in&nbsp;Italy. **PeR** operates in the agritourism space as a teaching&nbsp;facility.


## How did Fairtech begin?

### Teaching life’s necessities

During PeR’s 20 years of evolution, we have aimed to live in harmony with the environment and share what we&nbsp;learn. Doing so, we discovered life’s necessities fit neatly into five&nbsp;categories:

- **Health** for well-being and&nbsp;strength.
- **Education** is our interface with the&nbsp;world.
- **Food** is central to&nbsp;success.
- **Transport** is the&nbsp;community circulation&nbsp;system.<!--for strength and stability.-->
- **Shelter** became our primary engineering&nbsp;focus.

### Nothing new, but a revolution

This knowledge is very old. You can find links to each of the five areas in every civilisation – even ancient&nbsp;ones! 

Doctors, teachers, farmers, builders and drivers (of vehicles, animals, <!--like horses and --> and even&nbsp;rivers!)  are evidence of the longevity and importance of these&nbsp;areas.

<!--
Doctor. 👩‍⚕️ 
Teacher.👩‍🏫 
Farmer. 👨‍🌾 
Pedaler. 🚴‍♀️ mechanic.👨‍🔧 driver. 🐎 even driving the river!
Builder. 👷‍♂️
-->

What is different is IT (Information&nbsp;Technology). Exchanging ideas over the internet makes information virtually&nbsp;free! This affect is called: **zero marginal&nbsp;cost**. By sharing methods we can improve our feedback-loops helping others to thrive at zero marginal&nbsp;cost.

<!--### Five areas for any stable society:-->

### Five areas every human&nbsp;needs

- **Health** for <!--community -->well-being and&nbsp;fitness.
- **Education** to connect<!-- scientifically--> with the natural world.
- **Food** is central to ending scarcity.
- **Transport** is the circulation system of society.<!--for strength and stability.-->
- **Shelter** is the basis of security.

<!-- Remember this easily with **"HEFTS"**-->
> We call this<!-- acronym-->: **"HEFTS"**

<!--# Why basic pillars?

These are the basic pillar that need to be maintenance-free, with an energy reduction but without inconvenience or sacrificing comfort.
-->
# Why Health?

## <!--why health?--> Comfort is&nbsp;stressful

Modernity has brought many benefits. Although people living in comfort risk becoming weak due to under-use of the good health they already&nbsp;have.

## <!--what next?--> Human Technologies

Over thousands of years of&nbsp;evolution humans developed powerful _internal&nbsp;tools_, to stay strong in the face of natural&nbsp;adversity.

In order to maximise well-being we can engage the body, activate the mind and live <!--as closely -->as nature&nbsp;intended.

> All the resources we need are in the&nbsp;mind - Theodore&nbsp;Roosevelt (Ecological conservationist &amp;&nbsp;American&nbsp;statesman)

<!--
Living out of&nbsp;balance
- a lack of
- decline in strength
- There is a requirement to use the body for well-being.
- Everyone has powerful _internal&nbsp;tools_ which are a result of thousands of years of&nbsp;evolution – failure to do so weakens our immune system.

<!--#### About Theodore&nbsp;Roosevelt

Theodore&nbsp;Roosevelt was an American statesman, author, explorer, soldier, naturalist, and the youngest U.S. presidency, at 42.

Born in New York City on October 27, 1858, Theodore "Teddy" Roosevelt was governor of New York before becoming U.S. vice president. At age 42, Teddy Roosevelt became the youngest man to assume the U.S. presidency after President William McKinley was assassinated in 1901. He won a second term in 1904. Known for his anti-monopoly policies and ecological conservationism, Roosevelt won the Nobel Peace Prize for his part in ending the Russo-Japanese War. He died in New York on January 6, 1919.--> 

# Why Education?

## <!--why education?--> Connect with the natural&nbsp;world

When we study the world from behind screens such as smartphones and other devices, the experience is passive – lacking&nbsp;feedback. Technology has made enourous improvements to everyone's life, but education is a multi-sensory, physical&nbsp;activity. One that by definition should improve coordination and&nbsp;development.

## <!--what next?--> Practical, hands-on&nbsp;experience

There is an urgent need to understand the physical&nbsp;world. 

Our ancestors learned everything hands-on, in&nbsp;nature. 

Energetic tutelage, play and trial-and-error help inform mastery, improve coordination and develop focus. These are vital for discipline, applying abstract&nbsp;ideas and growth.

# Why Food?

## <!--why food?--> The end of&nbsp;scarcity

<!--Vegetation:

-->
The economic influence over food does not serve nutrition. There are several deep flaws that defy common-sense on the&nbsp;topic<!--conventional&nbsp;logic-->:

- At present, intensive&nbsp;agrigulture rewards commerce by&nbsp;_weight_.
- Industrial-scale waste at every level is&nbsp;alarming:
	- during the initial growing and production process&hellip;
	- complicated transit, refridgeration, preservative and packaging costs&hellip;
	- how much we buy and throw away&hellip;
	- and the absurd energy-to-plate ratio!

## <!--what next for food?--> Reclaim nourishment

Foods high in nutrition often require **less**&nbsp;resources. They are cheaper, lighter, easy to store, don't use&nbsp;packaging and can be efficiently grown&nbsp;locally<!-- requiring less&nbsp;transit-->.

By improving diet we reduce waste, lower costs and even _reverse_ the Climate&nbsp;Crisis.

<!--## Luxury produce

The scale of luxury produce such as meat is harming people's health and the planet's&nbsp;too.-->

## Better food&nbsp;security

Self-production is just one-step towards abundance. Even partial-production, in the garden, greenhouse or under-used space including urban rooftops, window farms and growing-kits can mushroom our food&nbsp;access.

<!--## Forage in the&nbsp;wild 

Learning about the local environment <!--can be tasty and&nbsp;nourishing-- > is&nbsp;delicious . To help distingush between poisionous <!--or illegal-- > or medicinal requires high quality references. When you know what's healthy and where to find it you can eat without spending a&nbsp;penny!-->

# Why Transport?

## <!--why transport?--> Society's circulation&nbsp;system

A person weighs about 80Kg. So, there's no reason to use vehicles that are heavier than we really&nbsp;need. But, what does a modern, rational transport network look&nbsp;like?

Our answers begin at community&nbsp;level with **The Light&nbsp;Bike**.

<!--Other key levels.-->

<!--Although, electric cars are not a futuristic idea, they are only part of the answer.-->

## Electrify <!-- the&nbsp;future--><!--Electric Wonderland-->

Electric transport is not a futuristic idea. Although there is often a trade-off between low energy and long&nbsp;distance.<!-- personal&nbsp;vehicles. -->

We developed **The Light&nbsp;Bike** which seems like a _complete&nbsp;contradiction_ in autonomy and energy&nbsp;use. 

<!-- Patents relating to electric cars go back to 1884, with an relatively sophisticated alkaline battery to debut in&nbsp;1913. [Thomas Edison and an electric car in 1913](https://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/10/18/in-1912-henry-ford-edison-came-together-to-conceive-a-low-priced-electric-car/)

# Why Shelter?

## <!--why shelter?--> The basis of&nbsp;security

Buildings in general require too much maintainence as they are commonly&nbsp;built. Houses, when designed properly can generate more than&nbsp;invested. And, buildings generally can act to _conserve the&nbsp;environment_, rather than spoil&nbsp;it.
