# Developed by **PeR**

**PeR** is pronounced in Italian as [Il Parco dell' Energia Rinnovabile](https://per.umbria.it), meaning "renewable energy park": [Learn more &#x279D;](https://inspiredlabs.co.uk/per.umbria.it/en/).

**PeR** is the largest and most comprehensive sustainability research centre in&nbsp;Italy. **PeR** operates in the agritourism space as a teaching&nbsp;facility.


## How did Fairtech begin?

### Teaching life’s necessities

During PeR’s 20 years of evolution, we have aimed to live in harmony with the environment and share what we&nbsp;learn. Doing so, we discovered life’s necessities fit neatly into five&nbsp;categories:

- **Health** for well-being and&nbsp;strength.
- **Education** is our interface with the&nbsp;world.
- **Food** is central to&nbsp;success.
- **Transport** is the&nbsp;community circulation&nbsp;system.<!--for strength and stability.-->
- **Shelter** became our primary engineering&nbsp;focus.

### Nothing new, but a revolution

This knowledge is very old. You can find links to each of the five areas in every civilisation – even ancient&nbsp;ones! 

Doctors, teachers, farmers, builders and drivers (of vehicles, animals, <!--like horses and --> and even&nbsp;rivers!)  are evidence of the longevity and importance of these&nbsp;areas.

<!--
Doctor. 👩‍⚕️ 
Teacher.👩‍🏫 
Farmer. 👨‍🌾 
Pedaler. 🚴‍♀️ mechanic.👨‍🔧 driver. 🐎 even driving the river!
Builder. 👷‍♂️
-->

What is different is IT (Information&nbsp;Technology). Exchanging ideas over the internet makes information virtually&nbsp;free! This affect is called: **zero marginal&nbsp;cost**. And by sharing means and&nbsp;ways – everyone can access the tools to thrive at zero marginal&nbsp;cost.

### Five areas every human&nbsp;needs

- **Health** for <!--community -->well-being and&nbsp;fitness.
- **Education** to connect<!-- scientifically--> with the natural world.
- **Food** is central to ending scarcity.
- **Transport** is the circulation system of society.<!--for strength and stability.-->
- **Shelter** is the basis of security.
