#### Conscious resource allocation

IMAGE

Conscious resource allocation makes economies of scale deficient. Thoughtful application of scarce raw materials increases resiliency.

Self-sufficient people appreciate more ecological benefits.

The de-emphasis of financialisation stunts exploitation. Grass-roots movements do not rely on complex intervention.

This differs from sustainability where any economic incentive seeks exploitation.

#### Sustainability model

IMAGE

Sustainability, unintentionally or otherwise is maligned by economic incentive.

At scale, there is always a way to "game the system".
