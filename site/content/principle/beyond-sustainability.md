Sustainability, unintentionally or otherwise is maligned by economic incentive.

Sometimes referred to as _Profit Over Purpose_.

<!--At scale, there is always a way to "game the system".-->

<!--
Conscious resource allocation.
How will climate affect access to resources?
What interventions will improve our natural habitat?
But how will this reduce the influence of money?
Can we strengthen the economy, yet not necessarily make it grow?
-->


Conscious resource allocation makes economies of scale deficient. Thoughtful application of scarce raw materials increases resiliency.

Self-sufficient people appreciate more ecological benefits.

The de-emphasis of financialisation stunts exploitation. Grass-roots movements do not rely on complex intervention.

<!--Differing from sustainability--> _Purpose Before Profit_ defelcts economic&nbsp;incentive and will become native through **Dematerialisation**


<!--The Main Event: Anthropological Mission

What's next?
- define the problem in more detail.
- Conscious resource allocation means:..
- Through ecological intervention we will:..
- Ecological improvement will include:
	- sequester = store (Latin, sequestrō: give up for safekeeping), seclude or withdraw: drawdown.
- background:
	- Anthropocene: The Human Epoch (Roughly translates as "recent-man" in Greek).
	- 4m years ago, earliest bi-ped.
	- First proposed as early as 1873, the Italian geologist Antonio Stoppani ().
	- The Anthropocene started with the Trinity test of 1945 (the first detonation of a nuclear device on July 16th 1945). X
	- there are two things to consider:
		- putting more emissions into the atmosphere worstening the problem.
		- reversing the problem by sequestering C02 and reversing the warming effect through coordinated action.
