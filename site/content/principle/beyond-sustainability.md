<!--In the section Beyond sustainability  i think that after the image of  ECONOMY( X) NATURAL RESORCE – ECOLOGY I think we have to better explain the reason     of the “X” on economy. Something like” Conscious resource allocation and intervening of ecology system  improvement will probably reduce the need of money, strengthening the economy without necessarily making it grow”.

The&nbsp;Three Actors

Principles of Sufficiency

Three Competing Interactions

Three Vital Inter-relationships

Three adaptive

Our meta relationship with the environment

What are: "Ecological" "interations" "economic" "natural resources" (as a holistic system)?

Human interactions with our planet depend on an analogy to a pl.

The economy meshes with natural resources, like a gear box, they need to travel without contradiction together, otherwise the car will stall.

the engine is making a noise, maybe we're not changing the gears properly.


economy+natural resources 
car = planet
the engine is making a noise = ecology 
engine = photosynthesis

Make HEFTS free, reduce the energy that goes into making things and build ... the goals are democratised.

What are material natural resource allocations trying to say?
What is economic stagnation communicating?
What is the climate crisis trying to communicate?

Sustainability, unintentionally or otherwise is maligned by economic incentive.

Sometimes referred to as _Profit Over Purpose_.

<!--At scale, there is always a way to "game the system".-->

Conscious resource allocation makes economies of scale deficient. Thoughtful application of scarce raw materials increases resiliency.

Self-sufficient people appreciate more ecological benefits.

The de-emphasis of financialisation stunts exploitation. Grass-roots movements do not rely on complex intervention.

<!--Differing from sustainability--> _Purpose Before Profit_ defelcts economic&nbsp;incentive and will become native through **Dematerialisation**.
