## How did Fairtech begin?

### Teaching life’s necessities

During PeR’s 20 years of evolution, we aimed to live in harmony with the environment and teach others what we learn. Doing so, we discovered life’s necessities fit neatly into five categories:

- **Health** for maintaining well-being and improving strength.
- **Education** is our interface with the world.
- **Food** is central to our success.
- **Transport** is the circulation system of our community.<!--for strength and stability.-->
- **Shelter** became our primary engineering focus.

### The next step for PeR

As PeR developed, we realised these five categories are special, they are **Transcalar**: meaning, they scale in all directions. And, they are just as important for communities, nomadic people, and developed civilisations all over the globe.

**Transcalar** also means that inside each community there is always a benefit from improvments to each area. <!--Your security doesn’t take away from someone else’s security. -->

This knowledge is very old. Professions linked to each area are found in all kinds of ancient civilisation: The Doctor, The Teacher, The Farmer, The Driver (of horses or other vehicles) and The Builder.

So, we set about developing our modern take on community resilience, called: Fairtech.

## Five areas for a stable society:

- **Health** for well-being and <!--community -->fitness.
- **Education** to connect<!-- scientifically--> with the natural world.
- **Food** is central to ending scarcity.
- **Transport** is the circulation system of society.<!--for strength and stability.-->
- **Shelter** is the basis of security.
