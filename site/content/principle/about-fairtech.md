# Developed by PeR

PeR is pronounced in [Italian](https://per.umbria.it) as Il Parco dell' Energia Rinnovabile, meaning "renewable energy park" [(learn more)](https://inspiredlabs.co.uk/per.umbria.it/en/). PeR is the largest and most comprehensive sustainability research centre in&nbsp;Italy. PeR operates in the agritourism space as a teaching&nbsp;facility.



## How did Fairtech begin?

### Teaching life’s necessities

During PeR’s 20 years of evolution, we've aimed to live in harmony with the environment and share this with&nbsp;others. Doing so, we discovered life’s necessities fit neatly into five&nbsp;categories:

- **Health** for well-being and improving&nbsp;strength.
- **Education** is our interface with the&nbsp;world.
- **Food** is central to everyone's&nbsp;success.
- **Transport** is the&nbsp;community circulation&nbsp;system.<!--for strength and stability.-->
- **Shelter** became our primary engineering&nbsp;focus.

### Resilience is transcalar

We realised these five categories are special. They are **Transcalar**: meaning, they scale in all directions. And, are just as important for communities, nomadic people, and developed civilisations – all over the&nbsp;globe!

**Transcalar** suggests there is always the potential to benefit from improvments. For example: improving your health is non-rivalrous – it won't change someone else’s&nbsp;well-being.

If you talk to people about **"HEFTS"**, you'll realise how **transcalar** this idea is because individuals, professionals, business leaders, politicians and global policy makers all have a role to play in making communities resilient that can overcome any challenge!

### Nothing new, but a revolution

This knowledge is very old and you can find links to each area in all kinds civilisation – even ancient&nbsp;ones! 

Doctors, Teachers, Farmers, Drivers (of vehicles, horses and other animals) and Builders are evidence of the longevity of these&nbsp;professions.

<!--Doctor. 👩‍⚕️ 
Teacher.👩‍🏫 
Farmer. 👨‍🌾 
Pedaler. 🚴‍♀️ mechanic.👨‍🔧 driver. 🐎 
Builder. 👷‍♂️ -->

What is different now the Internet makes information almost free! This affect is called: _zero marginal cost_, and we share designs, skills and ideas using the Collaborative&nbsp;Commons.

### The next step for PeR

Fairtech is a community resilience platform. Developed by PeR to share knowldge of self-sufficiency, encourage collaboration and beat future&nbsp;challenges.

### Five areas for any stable society:

- **Health** for well-being and <!--community -->fitness.
- **Education** to connect<!-- scientifically--> with the natural world.
- **Food** is central to ending scarcity.
- **Transport** is the circulation system of society.<!--for strength and stability.-->
- **Shelter** is the basis of security.
