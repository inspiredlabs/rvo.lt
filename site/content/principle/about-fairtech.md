# Developed by PeR

PeR is pronounced in [Italian](https://per.umbria.it) as Il Parco dell' Energia Rinnovabile, meaning "renewable energy park" [(learn more)](https://inspiredlabs.co.uk/per.umbria.it/en/). PeR is the largest and most comprehensive sustainability research centre in&nbsp;Italy. PeR operates in the agritourism space as a teaching&nbsp;facility.


## How did Fairtech begin?

### Teaching life’s necessities

During PeR’s 20 years of evolution, we've aimed to live in harmony with the environment and share what we&nbsp;learn. Doing so, we discovered life’s necessities fit neatly into five&nbsp;categories:

- **Health** for well-being and&nbsp;strength.
- **Education** is our interface with the&nbsp;world.
- **Food** is central to&nbsp;success.
- **Transport** is the&nbsp;community circulation&nbsp;system.<!--for strength and stability.-->
- **Shelter** became our primary engineering&nbsp;focus.

### Nothing new, but a revolution

This knowledge is very old. You can find links to each of the five areas in every civilisation – even ancient&nbsp;ones! 

Doctors, teachers, farmers, builders and drivers (of vehicles, animals, <!--like horses and --> even rivers!)  are evidence of the longevity and importance of these&nbsp;areas.

<!--
Doctor. 👩‍⚕️ 
Teacher.👩‍🏫 
Farmer. 👨‍🌾 
Pedaler. 🚴‍♀️ mechanic.👨‍🔧 driver. 🐎 even driving the river!
Builder. 👷‍♂️
-->

What is different is IT (Information Technology). Exchanging ideas over the internet makes information virtually free! This affect is called: **zero marginal cost**. By sharing design ideas and methods – everyone can access the tools to thrive at zero marginal&nbsp;cost.

### Five areas for any stable society:

- **Health** for well-being and <!--community -->fitness.
- **Education** to connect<!-- scientifically--> with the natural world.
- **Food** is central to ending scarcity.
- **Transport** is the circulation system of society.<!--for strength and stability.-->
- **Shelter** is the basis of security.
