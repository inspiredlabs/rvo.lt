<h1 id="visionforthefuture">PeR – vision for the future</h1>

<h2 id="nextstep">Rebooting Italy&#8217;s largest sustainability research centre</h2>

<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>The original idea behind PeR:</p>

<p>PeR began as a sustainability research centre. 10 years ago, the goal was educating others in the practice of low-impact living.</p>

<p>What PeR has achieved:</p>

<p>During that time, PeR gained experience as a training facility. We have shared many courses and the accommodation helped us gain a true exchange with our guests.</p>

<p>What is PeR now:</p>

<p>We have developed a training facility, an interactive lab, and become a source of ideas. Learning from each other has become a great knowledge-share opportunity.</p>

<p>The evolution of PeR:</p>

<p>Described as one of the most virtuous, surprising structures in Italy, we are curious. This environment has allowed us to explore the right solution to all sorts of problem. </p>

<p>The promise of sustainability:</p>

<p>PeR also has firsthand experience of failure. As a term, <em>Sustainability</em> is abused. And it is an important responsibility that we share our experience of failure. Doing so can help others avoid this costly disconnect.</p>

<p>The fundamental sustainability disconnect:
The reality is, the promise of sustainability has cynically peddled junk. </p>

<p>Now what?
As the <em>sustainability bandwagon</em> lurches into the sunset we aim to create a better future.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We embody the correct technology for people and planet.&#8221; – Alessandro Ronca, co-founder of PeR, Umbria. Alessandro has clear ideas, great skills and a motivated team of change-makers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The continued evolution of PeR:</p>

<p>We embody change. And we aim to do more. The next step is to challenge the present notion of progress. We aim to help people act differently – and in their own best interest. </p>

<p>Reforming ideas requires a different form of energy, also part of our evolution. </p>

<p>PHOTO</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Designed 15 years ago and open to visitors 10 years ago, PeR wants to challenge the present notion of progress. We love life and want a future without the risk of extinction!&#8221; – Alessandro Ronca.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Blind trust in technology is pollution:</p>

<p>As part of the knowledge-share at PeR, we question everything. The effectiveness of technological progress has produced blind trust. Misplaced trust is a form of pollution.
Novelty isn&#8217;t always better. </p>

<p>Old ideas, forgotten potential:</p>

<p>A real antique idea is that we need the latest technology, at any cost!
By exploring ancient methods, we have rediscovered how well they work. Low tech &amp; No tech solutions are under-utilised in society. We want people to share the ones that work.</p>

<p>Our approach to problem solving at PeR:</p>

<p>A better way is to combine ancient and modern methods. There is enormous potential in Low tech &amp; No tech solutions to explain first principles – the building blocks of knowledge. </p>

<p>PeR has a new purpose:</p>

<p>Cultivating change through R&amp;D and courses was just the beginning. By embracing &#8220;Change Artisans&#8221;, we want citizens to make meaningful change for themselves.</p>

<p>Aside:</p>

<p>Call-to-action: &#8220;Change Artisans&#8221; simplified into one sentence.</p>

<p>The guiding light of PeR:</p>

<p>PeR is a reference point for zero impact and positive impact problem solving. We want to open eyes showing demos of how things work. And open minds for people to realise how much they can do themselves.</p>

<p>Aside:</p>

<p>Technological sophistication:</p>

<p>It is essential we make the distinction between where something is useful, and what is possible:</p>

<ul>
<li>high-frequency broadband networks</li>
<li>ultra-powerful microprocessors</li>
<li>enormous horsepower vehicles</li>
<li>ultra-high definition video</li>
<li>extreme megapixel cameras</li>
</ul>

<p>Technological Sophistication from PeR:</p>

<p>With our experience of managing resources we have come to appreciate workable constraints. This has helped us establish fair expectations of various technologies.
These proportional boundaries produce a net-positive impact. </p>

<p>PHOTO</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The truly revolutionary impact of the Information Revolution will be social. As participation increases, distribution will create an efficiency feedback loop, reversing resource pressure. People will finally be able to do more with less.&#8221; – Scott Phillips on the amplification of availability.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Establishing enough:</p>

<p>The true revolution would be embracing coordination. Learning what technology is right for the planet requires understanding efficiency.
We are ready to share what we have found to be effective and shape a coordination strategy.</p>

<p>The coordination problem:</p>

<p>Self-sufficiency is hard, but scarcity has an instructional benefit. Development limits are proportional to available resources. </p>

<p>Beyond theory, sustainability practitioners need help:</p>

<ul>
<li>exploiting collaboration opportunities</li>
<li>connecting with other participants</li>
<li>leveraging collective intelligence</li>
<li>consolidating goals</li>
</ul>

<p>PeR online (create a simple business model):</p>

<p>The internet has enabled a global knowledge-share. PeR wants to move more activity online with: </p>

<ul>
<li>Change Courses.</li>
<li>Coordinating practical projects (pay what you can).</li>
</ul>

<p>The infinite growth delusion:</p>

<p>In recent memory, unsustainable debt took the financial system to breaking point. People do not want the burden of risk, and are looking beyond Consumerism for answers. </p>

<p>The PeR recipe:</p>

<p>Using common sense, we want to help. Working at the correct scale, with energy efficiency and the application of the sciences, we can share how to live more comfortably. We have already made a great start.</p>

<p>Community outreach program (pay-what-you-can).
- consultancy to get the local community sharing effective ideas from PeR through their network.</p>

<p>Aside:</p>

<p>Pay what you can – an inclusive business model
- Giving, helping and sharing is in our DNA: https://youtu.be/kYWvpy1eUu0?t=71</p>

<p>Shape the future of PeR:</p>

<p>PeR is open to the world.
We look forward to helping you directly with your project. We welcome: protagonists, project directors and active change makers to get in touch. Let&#8217;s make progress.</p>

<p>Change Artisans Revolt:</p>

<p>CTA</p>

<p>PeR is concentrating on:</p>

<ul>
<li>ways of saving resources</li>
<li>non-consumption of energy (reductionism)</li>
<li>reducing excess waste and non-production</li>
</ul>

<p>All practical, and without sacrifice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The earth does not belong to man, man belongs to the earth. – Chief Seattle, 1786–1866</p>
</blockquote>

<p>New Courses at PeR:</p>

<ul>
<li>organic training</li>
<li>R&amp;D research-stays</li>
<li>experiential laboratories</li>
</ul>

<p>Goal:</p>

<p>Improving our ability to act in a self-sufficient way and reduce demands on resources.</p>

<p>Conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is work in vain, that which can be done with less – Occam&#8217;s Razor, 14th Century case for empiricism</p>
